#Hard Drive Detection on Client Side 

A program is provided for detecting, unwanted hard-drive in a network environment. A host agent residing on a computing device in the network environment detects a new hard drive introduced to the computing device and sends the new hard drive to a network service for analysis. The network service is accessible to computing devices in the network environment i.e server side.

Thus the hard drive detection system has been implemented on java that can detect any external hard drive on the Server.
